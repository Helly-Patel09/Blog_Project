                 The Story of AWS and Andy Jassy’s Trillion Dollar Baby
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text desc">
                  For all of entrepreneurs and developers in the technology business, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is not something new. It has been a godsend in creating value for all.
                  AWS, the pioneer in cloud computing, has radically disrupted the global business landscape and the customer experience from the CIA to Apple Computer.
                  The defending champs are the old-guard purveyors of hardware and software: HP, IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, and VMware/EMC. The challengers are cloud computing platforms, pioneered by Amazon Web Services. The stakes are high. If old-guard tech gets checkmated, it stands to lose tens of billions in market value from the 
                  traditional hardware and software business models have delivered results for decades.
                  Amazon Web Services wasn’t any one person’s single idea. No proverbial apple fell on some Newton’s head, no Henry Ford or Steve Jobs-like character had a brainstorm. Instead, it rather emerged. The idea grew organically out of the company’s frustration with its ability to launch new projects and support customers.

              Object-Oriented Programming in Java
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text desc">
                  Object-Oriented Programming is a programming style that is associated with the concepts like class, object, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism. Most popular programming languages like Java, C++, C#, Ruby, etc. follow an object-oriented 
                  programming paradigm. In this blog, I will talk about object-oriented programming concepts in Java. An object-based application in 
                  Java is based on declaring classes, creating objects from them, and interacting between these objects. In this blog, we will understand the below core concepts of Object-oriented Programming in the following sequence:
              <ol>
                <li>Inheritance</li>
                <li>Encapsulation</li>
                <li>Abstraction</li>
                <li>Polymorphism</li>
              </ol>      
            </p>

               Understanding Artificial Intelligence
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text desc">
                  Artificial Intelligence are machines or computer programs that learn to perform tasks that require types of intelligence and that are usually performed by humans. And when we talk about types of intelligence, 
                  we need to rescue Jack Copeland’s reflection on what intelligence is: “the dominant thought in psychology considers human intelligence not as a single ability or cognitive process, but rather as a set of separate components. 
                  Research in AI has focused primarily on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and comprehension of language”.
